Tracking Assignment Overview
Build a Cargo Shipment Tracker application using the MERN stack. The app should include:
1. Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB):
○ API endpoints:
■ /shipments (GET) – Retrieve all shipments with their details (status, route, current location, ETA, etc.).
■ /shipment/:id (GET) – Retrieve details of a specific shipment.
■ /shipment/:id/update-location (POST) – Update the current location of the shipment.
■ /shipment/:id/eta (GET) – Retrieve the estimated time of arrival (ETA) based on current location and route data.
■ /shipment (POST) – Create a new shipment using container ID and other details.
○ Data modeling:
■ Shipment model: Fields for shipment ID, container ID, route (array of locations), current location, current ETA, status, etc.
2. Frontend (React, Redux):
○ Dashboard:
■ A tabular structure that lists all shipments, showing their ID, container ID, current location, ETA, status, and the ability to filter or sort based on shipment details.
■ A button to add a new shipment, which will open a form where users can input the container ID and shipment details.
○ Map integration:
■ Display the shipment’s current location on an interactive map (use libraries like react-leaflet or google-maps-react).
■ Show the entire route of the shipment with markers for key locations.
■ Show current ETA and other relevant data (current location, estimated arrival, etc.).
■ Allow the user to update the shipment location manually or through the backend (via the update-location endpoint).
Note
1. You should have two repositories, one for Webapp and another for the backend.
2. The repository should have a ReadMe.md file which has the steps to run the code, define the env variables used (if, any).
3. Feel free to make any assumptions while working on it and add them to the ReadMe.
4. (optional) Dockerise the code.
